I am a Robotics MS student at CMU since 2025.

I received a bachelorâ€™s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Yue Gao](https://gaoyue.sjtu.edu.cn/biography.html), [Yeqiang Qian](https://qianyeqiang.github.io), and [Ming Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0TCYA3YAAAAJ&hl=en). I visited Cornell University in 2024, advised by [Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://sites.google.com/site/tapomayukh).
